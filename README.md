## grid-template

### In this project, I practiced
- in using the structure of the project,
- in using SCSS with all the features that make it easier to work with CSS code,
- and adhered to a strict pixel perfect template for layout.
- The page is responsive and adaptive.

## The project has been uploaded to github pages from this link [https://pursam.github.io/grid-template/](https://pursam.github.io/grid-template/)
